# [Reload Broken Images](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/reload-broken-images)

## Description

This user script tries to reload broken images, which usually happen if the server is over loaded or the user's internet connection is slow.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) extension installed in your browser. The script has been tested on both Chrome and Edge with Violentmonkey.

Once you have Violentmonkey installed, you can simply click on the following link:

[Install this script](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/raw/main/dist/reload-broken-images/reload-broken-images.user.js)

## Usage

Once installed, the script will add a menu command called "Reload broken images", that activates the script every time it is clicked.

## Limitations

This script does not load images that are not available already. Also, the reloading is done gradually image by image.
