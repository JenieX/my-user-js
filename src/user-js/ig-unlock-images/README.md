# [Instagram Unlock Images](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/ig-unlock-images)

## Description

This user script unlocks the context menu on Instagram images, allowing you to save or copy the image, open it in a new tab, and more.

It's worth noting that the main focus of this user script is the direct pages of users, as that's how the author is used to using Instagram. While it should work on the main page of Instagram and the single posts pages, it may have some issues there.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) extension installed in your browser. The script has been tested on both Chrome and Edge with Violentmonkey.

Once you have Violentmonkey installed, you can simply click on the following link:

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically unlock the context menu on images on Instagram.

## Limitations

This script is designed to work with the current version of Instagram as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility.

In addition, the script may conflict with other user scripts or browser extensions that modify the behavior of Instagram.
