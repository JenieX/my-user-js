    "description": "This user script unlocks the context menu on Instagram images, allowing you to save or copy the image, open it in a new tab, and more.\n\nIt's worth noting that the main focus of this user script is the direct pages of users, as that's how the author is used to using Instagram. While it should work on the main page of Instagram and the single posts pages, it may have some issues there.",
    "usage": "Once installed, the script will automatically unlock the context menu on images on Instagram.",
    "limitations": "This script is designed to work with the current version of Instagram as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility.\n\nIn addition, the script may conflict with other user scripts or browser extensions that modify the behavior of Instagram."
