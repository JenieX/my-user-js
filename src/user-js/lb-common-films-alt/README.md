# [Letterboxd Common Films Alt](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/lb-common-films-alt)

## Description

This is an alternative version of my original script [Letterboxd Common Films](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/lb-common-films) with few exceptions:

- Movies that you have watched but not rated will not be listed, and because of that..
- The script now retrieves movies data much faster, providing quicker results.
- You can request data for multiple users, but please use this feature responsibly.
- You will have to provide your username to the script via the menu command option.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) extension installed in your browser. The script has been tested on both Chrome and Edge with Violentmonkey.

Once you have Violentmonkey installed, you can simply click on the following link:

[Install this script](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/raw/main/dist/lb-common-films-alt/lb-common-films-alt.user.js)

## Usage

After installing the script, navigate to your script manager's menu command options and select the "Set your account username" option. Please see the limitations section below for more details.

The list of common films is color-coded to indicate the level of match between your rating and the user's rating:

- Royal Blue: Perfect match
- Purple: Strong match
- Green: Good match
- Orange: Fair match
- Red: Weak match

## Limitations

Currently, the script works only on the members, likes, and fans pages of movies on Letterboxd.

This script is designed to work with the current version of Letterboxd as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility.
