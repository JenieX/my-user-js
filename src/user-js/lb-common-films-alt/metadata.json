    "description": "This is an alternative version of my original script [Letterboxd Common Films](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/lb-common-films) with few exceptions:\n\n- Movies that you have watched but not rated will not be listed, and because of that..\n- The script now retrieves movies data much faster, providing quicker results.\n- You can request data for multiple users, but please use this feature responsibly.\n- You will have to provide your username to the script via the menu command option.",
    "usage": "After installing the script, navigate to your script manager's menu command options and select the \"Set your account username\" option. Please see the limitations section below for more details.\n\nThe list of common films is color-coded to indicate the level of match between your rating and the user's rating:\n\n- Royal Blue: Perfect match\n- Purple: Strong match\n- Green: Good match\n- Orange: Fair match\n- Red: Weak match",
    "limitations": "Currently, the script works only on the these pages:\n\n- Members, fans, and likes pages of movies\n- Followers and following pages of users\n- User films page\n\nThis script is designed to work with the current version of Letterboxd as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility."
