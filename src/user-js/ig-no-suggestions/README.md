# [Instagram No Suggestions](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/tree/main/src/user-js/ig-no-suggestions)

## Description

This user script completely removes the suggested posts from Instagram timeline.

If you want to see these posts again, simply disable or uninstall this script.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) extension installed in your browser. The script has been tested on both Chrome and Edge with Violentmonkey.

Once you have Violentmonkey installed, you can simply click on the following link:

[Install this script](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js/raw/main/dist/ig-no-suggestions/ig-no-suggestions.user.js)

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically removes the suggested posts.

## Limitations

The removal of the suggested posts will cause the main timeline page to be usually empty, meaning any scrolling would trigger a request for more data. Therefore, I introduced a delay of 5 seconds between requests that are likely to contain more suggested posts.

This script is designed to work with the current version of Instagram as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility.

In addition, the script may conflict with other user scripts or browser extensions that modify the behavior of Instagram.
