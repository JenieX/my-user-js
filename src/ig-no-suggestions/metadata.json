    "usage": "Once installed, the script will automatically removes the suggested posts.",
    "limitations": "The removal of the suggested posts will cause the main timeline page to be usually empty, meaning any scrolling would trigger a request for more data. Therefore, I introduced a delay of 5 seconds between requests that are likely to contain more suggested posts.\n\nThis script is designed to work with the current version of Instagram as of the script's last update. It may not work with future versions of the site, and may require updates to maintain compatibility.\n\nIn addition, the script may conflict with other user scripts or browser extensions that modify the behavior of Instagram."
